	The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat
	Boggis, squat Bunce,
	and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and
	his family surrounded.
	What they don't know is that they're not dealing with just
	any fox - Mr. Fox
	would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever
	can save him now.
